I'm excited to introduce a major update to Pockity that brings Liquid Glass design, and compatibility support for iOS 26 and macOS 26.

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a [review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1475098830?action=write-review). It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.

### New

- New App icon based on Liquid Glass design principles
- `iPadOS`: Supports better menu integration on iPadOS when running in window mode for external input devices.
- Zoom transitions for relevant actions from new bar items and edit context menu actions

### Improvements

- Multiple improvements and fixes to the Sankey diagrams
- Subtitles are now directly used on iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 for views.
- Window titles now display the current detail view name in the app switcher
- Improved importing data
- `iOS`: Added option to import data from the onboarding splash screen
- Simpler widget views with improvements for type legitibility. Major overhaul of widgets scheduled soon
