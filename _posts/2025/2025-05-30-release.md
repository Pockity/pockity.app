I'm excited to introduce a major update to Pockity that makes tracking your budget and expenses more intuitive and seamless than ever. This update brings a host of new features, improvements, and fixes for the iOS app.

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a [review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1475098830?action=write-review). It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.

### New 

- New Recurring details view, displaying:
  - New header displaying relevant details about the item
  - New button in the context now prompts to create a new entry from the recurring item 
  - The full list of entries created during the span of the recurring item

- Fixed a bug wherein recurring items would create duplicates on their schedule

- Fixed a bug where the recurring editor would show an incorrect format for the recurrence rule once configured. It no longer shows the "for 500 times..." suffix.

This release also completes the redesign pipeline I begun in December, 2024. It was a great opportunity working in tandem with some talented minds at the fruit company here in India, and their feedback throughout the process has created a lasting impact on the iOS app.
