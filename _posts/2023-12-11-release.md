The December release brings a improvements and bug fixes to both the iOS and mac apps.

This will be last release for the year. I'll be working on some highly requested features next, but until then, happy holidays and have a great new year! 

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a [review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1475098830?action=write-review). It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.

### Improvements

- Sync monitor now displays cloud events grouped by type (sync, import and export). 

### Fixes

- Fixed a major bug where moving entries across private and shared ledgers would cause the apps to stop syncing until the moved entry was deleted from the app. 
- Fixed syncing smart filters
- `macOS`: Enables following actions on rows:
  - Delete
  - Copy
  - Paste
  - Paste on Today (current date-time)
  
  and undo/redo for the above actions.
