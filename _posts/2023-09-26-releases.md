---
<br />

Apple released [macOS 14: Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/) earlier today, and Pockity v2023.8.0 - v2023.8.2 brings stable support for the app on macOS 14.

Two additional releases were released after [v2023.8.0](/blog/2023-09-18/release/), containing the following fixes and improvements:

### Improvements

- widgets and complications are now reloaded less fequently, and update more reliably 

- `watchOS`: improved layout/drawing for recurring and categories lists

- `watchOS`: improved sorting of recurring events based on their next dates

- `iOS`: improved connectivity to the watch app

- shows recurring detail correctly after tapping on upcoming expenses widget

### Fixes 

- fixed a rare crash that would occur when validating entries

- `iOS`: fixed some minor bugs when opening the entry editor after the initial setup

- `watchOS`: fixed some crashes when creating a new entry

- `watchOS`: Fixed budget complication incorrect text label

- `iOS`: fixed recurrring detail view not scrolling when viewing past transactions 

- `macOS`: fixed Purchases tab incorrectly showing Family plan purchased for users who had purchased the family upgrade plan on iOS instead.

- `macOS`: fixed a crash in the timeline view

A troubling incident also came to light: a few users were purchasing Pockity+ or the respective family plans, and then immediately requesting refunds within the day from Apple. 

This would be normal in most cases, but the 24-hour time period struck me odd. Upon investigating, I realised a bug in Pockity's purchases code which resulted in such refunds to continue granting access to Pockity+ features access to such installations. 

This has since been patched, and this *hack* will no longer work. 

This bug is separate from the one outlined in the fixes list for macOS.
