## Terms of Use

**Pockity+** is a one time purchase for iOS and iPadOS which unlocks all features of the app and removes all limitations. This purcahse is different for the Mac app and two are non-transferrable. 

Use of Pockity is governed by [Apple's Standard EULA](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/) for apps.

**Tips** provided in Pockity do no unlock any additional content in the app. 

**Subscriptions** will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription. Auto-renewal may be turned off by the user, by going to the userâ€™s Account Settings after purchase. The duration and price of each subscription is displayed on the purchase screen, and updated at the time of purchase.
