Hello planners, you can now share Pockity+ with your Family 🎉

This is a new separate purchase type added to the app, and with a single purchase, you can get Pockity+ for yourself and all members of your family added under your Apple ID. 

If you have already purchased Pockity+, you’ll see a Pockity+ for Family upgrade which is of the equivalent price of the full bundle. This is only there in-case you need to upgrade now or in the future.
