I'm excited to introduce a major update to Pockity that makes tracking your budget and expenses more intuitive and seamless than ever. This update brings a host of new features, improvements, and fixes for the macOS app.

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a [review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1475098830?action=write-review). It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.

### New 

A new onboarding, for first time users on iOS and iPadOS, guides users with concepts of the app, and helping them navigate their first expense and account.

There is also a new homescreen (sidebar on iPadOS) which brings forth more information and content.

### Improvements

- The NLP parser has been massively improved, trained on real-world data for optimum performance, and is now more capable in more languages.

- Multiple UI, stability, and rendering improvements for Sankey charts.

### Fixes

- Fixed a crash which occurred when applying filters created using the older format.
