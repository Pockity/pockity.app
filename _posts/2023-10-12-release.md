The October release brings a new widget size for the Entry widget (iOS), and additional improvements and fixes.

I'd appreciate if you could take a moment to review the App on the App Store.

### Improvements

- `iOS`: new large size for Entry widget

- privacy improvements to widgets

- improved caching of data

### Fixes

- `iOS`: fixed a crash that would sometimes occur when creating a transfer entry

- `watchOS`: fixed category budget gauge extending over when over-budget 

- `watchOS` fixed category budget indicators appearing incorrectly positioned on smaller watches
